## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(pgamma(2, 3))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.




# Rmarkdown is like Jupyter notebooks: running grayed-out section returns output

```{r, echo=FALSE}
x <- seq(0,10,len=1000) # a monotonous sequence of 1K samples from 0 to 10
f.x <- dgamma(x,shape=1,scale=2)
```



plot(x,dgamma(x,shape=1,scale=2),type="l",ylim=c(0,0.5),col='2')
lines(x,dgamma(x,shape=2,scale=2),type="l",ylim=c(0,0.5),col='3')
lines(x,dgamma(x,shape=3,scale=2),type="l",ylim=c(0,0.5),col='4')
lines(x,dgamma(x,shape=4,scale=2),type="l",ylim=c(0,0.5),col='5')
legend(4,0.5,legend=c("alpha=1","alpha=2","alpha=3","alpha=4"),lty=c(1,1,1,1),col=
         c(2,3,4,5))
